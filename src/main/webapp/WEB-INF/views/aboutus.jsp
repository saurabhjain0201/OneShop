<b>Online shopping made easy at OneShop</b>
Gone are the days, when you had to go on exhausting shopping trips and wait in long queues to buy something. Today, with online shopping,
everything you need is right at your fingertips. For instance, there's this big party thrown by your friend, or your sister's getting 
married, and you need a new dress, in fact you need more than one dress, you need matching shoes, accessories, bags and makeup.
You have to get all these things soon, possibly before the weekend. And you can't even take a day off from work to go shopping 
in a crowded mall. What do you do? You can't delegate someone else to buy these things for you. What if they bring something you
don't like? You can't even return those things and get your money back.

<b>Easy Return and Replacement Policies</b>
Imagine you've bought an expensive jacket from Mango, or a pair of Steve Madden heels; the price, color, everything was to your liking when
you ordered the product at our site. But when the order reached you, you found the color of the jacket not to your liking or the shoes a tad
bit loose or tight; or say you are unhappy with the product for some reason, you can easily return the product and get your money back.
Or you can also return it and ask for another size, without paying extra money. Online shopping at our site also makes sure that you enjoy faster delivery.

<b>EMI Makes Everything Affordable</b>
So you need a new washing machine or a new smartphone. Since they don't come cheap, buying them will need a lot of money. Although your payday is just around the
corner, you have other commitments too, and you cannot pay for the washing machine or mobile in one shot. What will you do? Beg, borrow, steal? There's no need
to resort to any of these desperate measures, especially when you can buy your favourite products at EMI from our online store.

<b>Want To Understand a Product Better? Check Our Buying Guides</b>
So you are planning to buy a refrigerator for your home, or you want to invest in some gym equipment, but you don't understand head or tail about these products.
When you look at the products and their huge list of specifications, things look Greek and Latin to you. You decide to listen to your colleague and end up buying
a refrigerator that you don't like. Or you spend thousands on gym equipment that you didnâ€™t really need. Rather than making such an expensive mistake, go through
our buying guides for various categories of products and make your online shopping experience the best ever.
